	<h1 style="font-size:35px; font-family:Algerian">About COVID 19</h1><br>
	<p align="justify" style="font-size:20px">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory disease caused by <b>severe acute
	respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)</b>. The COVIDâ€“19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing pandemic of <b>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19)</b>. It was first identified in December 2019 in <b>Wuhan, China</b>. The outbreak was declared a <b>Public Health Emergency of International Concern</b> in January 2020 and a pandemic in March 2020. As of 26 October 2020, more than <b>43.9 million cases</b> have been confirmed, with more than <b> 1.15 million deaths</b> attributed to COVID-19.</p>
	
	 <p  align="justify" style="font-size:20px">COVID-19 spreads most often when people are physically close. It spreads very easily and sustainably through the <b>air, primarily via small droplets or aerosols, as an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, sings, or speaks</b>. It may also be transmitted via <b>contaminated surfaces</b>, although this has not been conclusively demonstrated. <b>Airborne transmission</b> from aerosol formation is suspected to be the main mode of transmission. It can spread from an infected person for up to two days before they display symptoms, and from people who are asymptomatic. People remain infectious for seven to twelve days in moderate cases, and up to two weeks in severe cases.
	 </p>
	 <p  align="justify" style="font-size:20px">Common symptoms include <b>fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste</b>. Complications may include <b>pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome</b>. The incubation period is typically around five days but may range from 1 to 14 days. There are several vaccine candidates in development, although none have completed clinical trials. There is no known specific antiviral medication, so primary treatment is currently symptomatic.</p>
	 <h1 style="font-size:35px; font-family:Algerian">Coronavirus In India</h1>
	 <p  align="justify" style="font-size:20px">The first case of COVID-19 in India, was reported on 30 January 2020. India currently has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia, and has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States, with almost <b>3,64,13,667</b> reported cases of COVID-19 infection, more than <b>6,27,281</b> and more than <b>29,923,320</b> recovered. By mid of 2020, India had approached in position of conducting highest number of daily tests in the world which subsequently translated into highest number of daily new cases in world and has sustained highest number of daily cases.
	 </p>
	 <p  align="justify" style="font-size:20px">On 22 March, India observed a 14-hour voluntary public curfew at the insistence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was followed by mandatory lockdowns in COVID-19 hotspots and all major cities. Further, on 24 March, the prime minister ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, affecting the entire 1.3 billion population of India. On 14 April, India extended the nationwide lockdown till 3 May which was followed by two-week extensions starting 3 and 17 May with substantial relaxations. From 1 June, the government started "unlocking" the country (barring "containment zones") in three unlock phases.
	 </p>
	 <p  align="justify" style="font-size:20px">In March, after the lockdown was imposed, <b>the United Nations (UN)</b> and the <b>World Health Organization (WHO)</b> praised India's response to the pandemic as <b>'comprehensive and robust'</b>, terming the lockdown restrictions as 'aggressive but vital' for containing the spread and building necessary healthcare infrastructure. At the same time, the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) noted the government's swift and stringent actions, emergency policy-making, emergency investment in health care, fiscal stimulus, and investment in vaccine and drug R&D and gave India a score of 100 for the strict response. Also in March, Michael Ryan, chief executive director of the WHO's health emergencies programme noted that India had tremendous capacity to deal with the outbreak owing to its vast experience in eradicating smallpox and polio. In June, <b>India was ranked 56th of 200 countries</b> in COVID-19 safety assessment report by <b>Deep Knowledge Group</b>.
